Sometimes I teach SAS in STAC32/STAC33, sometimes not. This website has some notes and code that will get you started with SAS, at the level of STAC32 or STAC33 (in fact, using a lot of the same examples).

Use the top bar to get to my lecture slides and code. There aren't any lecture videos yet, though there might be eventually.
